# AE/VAE-SOM
# TODO：
- [ ] Learn how to optimize the learning process. (We can take inspiration from the package minisom)
- [ ] Calculate the transition matrix with the training data

To Do:

Investigate correlation between the common input vs. faulty input

How to process the biodirectional arrow in the Common trajectroy?

How to down sample the z_e?

Markov Model 


---Updated June 4th:

Fixed up the Markov Chain. Need to be validated.

Note: The Markov Chain is not the only method to optimize the temporal model.

I will continue to work for this part after building the framework.

To do list:

Tidy the source code. 

Change the dataset. 

Add a new block for anomaly detecion in Spatial space. It needs to test more to avoid FP.

The hyper-parameters needs to be clarify in order to get a better results in SOM

$\sigma$ means the divergence of the data. sigma is larger, the results are more dispersed.

$\sigma$ should be around $0.5 \rightarrow 1.5$

$Learning rate $ should be around $0.5 \rightarrow 2.5$
