To Do:

Investigate correlation between the common input vs. faulty input

How to process the biodirectional arrow in the Common trajectroy?

How to down sample the z_e?

Markov Model 


---Updated June 4th:

Fixed up the Markov Chain. Need to be validated.

Note: The Markov Chain is not the only method to optimize the temporal model.

I will continue to work for this part after building the framework.

To do list:

Tidy the source code. 

Change the dataset.
